      Responsibilities include:
      - Architect automatic pipelines for reconstructing patient-specific anatomical structures from CT images 
        - Impact: replaced the company's reliance on third-party software, resulting in an estimated $470,000/year savings in licensing fees, reduced processing time per case by 30%, and enabled control over data privacy and regulatory compliance in a medical imaging workflow.
      - Build and maintain machine learning models for various tasks including landmark detection, 3D image segmentation, point-cloud clustering, etc.
      - Develop applications that enable verification and validation of outputs of automatic pipelines

## About Me
I’m a data scientist and engineer working at the intersection of ML, cloud infrastructure, and medical imaging. I’ve built **image segmentation and landmark detection pipelines that span the full ML lifecycle** — from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, deployment, and monitoring — deployed across both AWS and on-premise environments. <br>\
My work emphasizes *human-in-the-loop* systems, especially critical in the medical domain where model outputs must be rigorously verified and interpretable. I’m passionate about bridging the gap between robust technical engineering and safe, usable clinical software.
