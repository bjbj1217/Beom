**Problem**\
Develop a robust segmentation algorithm to create an accurate reconstruction of aortic valve using cardiac Computed Tomography (CT) scans

**Background**\
Typically presenting as a tri-leaflet structure, the aortic valve is a unidirectional valve located in the aortic root, the section of the aorta that attaches to the heart.
The aortic root consists of multiple structural components that function together to maintain the body's optimal blood flow.
