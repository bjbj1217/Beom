**Objective:**\
Train and validate a detection model to regress the coordinates of fifteen aortic landmarks from cardiac Computed Tomography (CT) scans
<!--more-->

**Background**\
Please refer to [Landmark-guided Segmentation]({{< relref "Landmark-Guided Segmentation/index.md" >}}) for the motivation behind this work.
The 15 aortic landmarks altogether define the overall structures of aortic valve leaflets. 

There exist several distinct architectures for landmark detection task.
